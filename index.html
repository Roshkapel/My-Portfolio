            <h4 class="sub_headings">Summary</h4>
            <p class="sub_headings">
                I have created web applications from using <span class="hilights_and_headings">web forms</span> with <span class="hilights_and_headings">C# </span>and OOP to using vite and rollup 
                <span class="hilights_and_headings">js bundlers</span> along with <span class="hilights_and_headings">react</span> and <span class="hilights_and_headings">D3</span> for data visualization.
                I have garnered up to three (3) years of experience in software development and thinking strategically and algorithmically when creating applications.
                Languages I have used include <span class="hilights_and_headings">C#</span>, <span class="hilights_and_headings">Python</span>, <span class="hilights_and_headings">Javascript</span>, 
                <span class="hilights_and_headings">HTML5</span> and <span class="hilights_and_headings">CSS3</span>. I am also familiar with basic computer networking protocols and network setups. 
                In terms of data management, I have experience working with Microsoft SQL Server for setting up and managing databases usinng intermediate level queries and scripts.
                I know have working knowledge of creating web applications with razor pages and MVC using ASP.Net in Visual Studio. My main goal as a developer is to design intriguing,
                dynamic user interfaces and easy to use navigation features. I believe my strong suit is in UI design, but my passion is for server side 
                and API development which I am independently researching and studying now. On this page, I hope you find the skills and qualities that are valuable to your organization.
                Maw we find each other on the same team creating something beautiful and long lasting.

                            Collaborated with a team to design, implement and update a business software system from drafting 
                            the proposal documents including feasibility reports, statement of requirements, system identification 
                            and specifications, project selection and system testing documents to developing and testing the application.

                        <p>
                            Developed a basic pixel game with functions that allow movement in different directions using JavaScript and CSS for positioning, simulation of gravity
                            and styling respectively. The project was completed as a part of a Javascript certificate pursued on Freecodecamp. The purpose of this particular course was to 
                            implement OOP style programming using Javascript.

                        Thy sense of self
                        For I think it be.
                        Lo’ thy thoughts have become Me,
                        Drowning, as if, a vacuum in time.
                        Thy presence remains no friend of mine.
                        But grant thee sight to see him, Me.
                        Not thine self I think it be.

                    Science and philosophy are both disciplines that allow me to appreciate the mind and all dimensions of human intelligence, imagination, and communication through the arts and other mediums.
                    Growing up in the rough inner cities of Kingston, Jamaica, I always aspired to being a scientist. When the opportunity finally presented itself, choosing a career path in computer science was an easy choice.
                    I started my journey to becoming a software developer by completing my associate of science degree in management information systems at the Excelsior Community College in Kingston, Jamaica. I have since developed various web applications and designed interfaces many of which I am proud to take for.
                    After migrating to the USA, I was accepted into the Christopher Newport University as a transfer student and it was game on from there, a professional developer in the making.
                    Now a General Programmer at Project Lemma, I enjoy being a part of a team that is passionate about education and technology. I use my programming skills and experience here at Project Lemma to support and maintain system functionality from server-side handling to data management and interface designs to optimize end user experience.
                    While pursing my bachelor’s degree in computer science at CNU, I still learn and engage on platforms such as Freecodecamp, Microsoft learning platforms, Stack-Overflow, and Github. Whenever I am not learning or building something I grab a controller and mash some buttons for fun, do some research or watch movies. My motto for software development is: “if it’s great, it won’t break”.
                    I look forward to the journey ahead.
